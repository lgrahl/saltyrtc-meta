# SaltyRTC

SaltyRTC is an **end-to-end encrypted signalling protocol**. It offers
to freely choose from a range of signalling tasks, such as setting up a
**WebRTC** or **ORTC** peer-to-peer connection. SaltyRTC is completely
open to new and custom signalling tasks for everything feasible.

In this repository, you can find...

* The [SaltyRTC Signalling Protocol](Protocol.md).
* The [SaltyRTC WebRTC Task Protocol](Task-WebRTC.md) to set up a
  secure WebRTC peer-to-peer connection by using SaltyRTC's end-to-end
  encryption techniques.
* The [SaltyRTC ORTC Task Protocol](Task-ORTC.md) to set up a secure
  ORTC peer-to-peer connection.
* The [SaltyRTC Chunking Specification](Chunking.md) used by SaltyRTC's
  WebRTC task. However, the specification can also be used as a generic
  message chunking solution.
